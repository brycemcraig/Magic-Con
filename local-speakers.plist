		<key>notes</key>
		<string>David Acer is an award-winning writer, comedian, and inventor of magic tricks who has done crazy things on television shows around the world, like protesting outside a train station dressed as a giant penny while inviting people to lie down on the tracks to “see how it feels.” And limping to the couch for a talkshow interview with a Denver boot on his leg because he had “a few unpaid j-walking tickets.” But younger viewers (and insomniacs) are more likely to recognize him as “Doubting Dave” from the syndicated show, Mystery Hunters, which earned him two Gemini nominations (the Canadian equivalent of the Emmys) for Best Writing in a Children’s Non-Fiction Series, and the publication of his spin-off book, GOTCHA!, now a Canadian bestseller. Over the past 25 years, David has also published an eclectic array of groundbreaking magic, leading to performances at The Magic Castle, lectures at F.I.S.M., and the 2009 Magician of the Year award from the Canadian Association of Magicians.</string>

		<key>notes</key>
		<string>Ricky Smith may have founded the Buck Twins, but Lance Pierce gave birth to Ricky Smith, making him the grandparent of all that is good and wholesome about modern card magic. What sometimes passes for a wry wit is actually the complete absence of any at all, and this is his secret weapon when stalking the bars and nightclubs, looking for anybody who will actually stay to the end of a trick. “Remember,” he constantly cautions us, “spectators are liars and fools, and just because they repeatedly insist that you didn’t get the right card doesn’t mean you can’t make them tip you a fiver.” Such advice has proved invaluable in providing Lance a remarkable living and staying half a step ahead of the law. Except for the time in Chicago. And Florida. And the years 2003-2007. No matter; he still enjoys performing magic everywhere, as long as it doesn’t involve the crossing of state lines. With 30 years of dedicated practice and influence from generations of masters , Lance has entertained audiences from all over the world with his own unique touch. Even with his success, the hat he’s most proud to wear though is student-ever perusing the next beautiful idea.</string>

The rest of his greatness can be attributed to his position as Student in Residence at the distinctive Conjuring Arts Research Center. Previously he worked for H &amp; R Magic Books which he says was “awesome”, and he likes difficult sleight of hand that is elegant in construction. His founding of the Buck Twins consisted of teaching Dan and Dave a couple of tricks when they were first getting started and for otherwise giving them an excellent example of what not to do.</string>
